# Attaining-Stationarity-Electric-Porduction

This repo shows multiple methods to convert a non- stationary data set to a stationary one.
The following methods were implemented:
# 1. Differencing
# 2. ETS Decomposition
# 3. Simple Moving Average and Exponential Moving Average
# 4. Double Exponential Smoothing - Holts Model
# 5. Triple Exponential Smoothing - Holts Winter Model - Seasonal Trend Model
